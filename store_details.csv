Our Story
At A&W, great burgers come first! So it's only natural that we're the first and only national burger restaurant in Canada to serve beef raised without the use of hormones or steroids. We're also the first and only national burger restaurant in Canada to serve chicken raised without the use of antibiotics. Our eggs are farmed right here in Canada, from hens fed a vegetarian diet without animal by-products. We're also proud to serve organic, Fairtrade coffee blended for us by Master Roaster Van Houtte.

Our Story
Enliven Your Moment with APRIL SWEETS
April, the loveliest month of spring, is bedecked in pastel blooms that evoke the tender, velvety frosting of a freshly-baked cake, stirring our senses with wonder. The rain showers, like heaven-sent blessings, grace the earth with a bewitching touch, adorning each raindrop with a kaleidoscope of colours that glisten like rainbow sprinkles on the delectable cake. The vibrant hues of the season blend together in a glossy chocolate ganache drizzle, that cascades over this designer cake like a masterful work of art. It's a sensory symphony that evokes wonder and marvel, a feast for the eyes and the soul. 
A Cake Shop Beyond Compare
At April Sweets, we are not just an ordinary cake shop, but rather a group of cake aficionados dedicated to creating a wide variety of handcrafted, cutting-edge cakes and cupcakes for every occasion. Our accomplished artisans have over 15 years of expertise, continuously innovating and reinventing classic recipes based on customer feedback. The outcome is an unparalleled delicacy that is low in sugar yet high in flavour, light, fresh, and luscious with every bite. 
Elevating Your Celebrations
We produce sumptuous, meticulously frosted cakes and serve them with extraordinary customer care in a welcoming and warm atmosphere. Whether it's a birthday, anniversary, graduation, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas, or a relaxed tea time with friends, our cakes and cupcakes are certain to enhance your experience. From the ultra soft-n-fluffy layered chiffon cake to the freshly frosted cupcakes, we cater to all your needs. 
Finest Ingredients for a Healthy Lifestyle
At April Sweets, we prioritize your well-being above all else. Our ingredients are of the highest quality, natural, seasonal, and authentic. We exclusively partner with suppliers who meet our stringent criteria, from Ontario-grown strawberries to Madagascar bourbon vanilla beans and Valrhona Chocolate from Tain l'Hermitage, France. Every single item we create is freshly baked from scratch, utilizing 100% locally-sourced Canadian dairy, eggs, butter, and other natural elements. We never include any artificial components, such as margarine, shortening, non-dairy cream, cocoa butter replacer, or food stabilizers. You can indulge in our exquisite cakes with a bright smile, confident that you nourish your body and soul.
Now open in the Dufferin Mall food court, next to New York Fries.
